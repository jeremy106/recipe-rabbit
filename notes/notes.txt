### Setup steps: ###
setup service account [x]
install google cloud cli [x]
Create local authentication credentials [x] -- https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/set-up-adc-local-dev-environment
  Credentials saved to file: [/home/jeremy/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json]
  These credentials will be used by any library that requests Application Default Credentials (ADC).
  Quota project "recipe-rabbit-452123" was added to ADC which can be used by Google client libraries for billing and quota. Note that some services may still bill the project owning the resource.
